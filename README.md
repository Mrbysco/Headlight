# Headlight #

## About ##
Headlight is a mod that adds a helmet that can store a light source inside it. By inserting a torch, lantern, or other light-emitting item, the helmet will provide illumination, making mining and adventuring in dark areas much easier. The inserted light source can be swapped at any time, allowing for different lighting intensity depending on what is used.
